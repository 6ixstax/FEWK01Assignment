        <font size="6">The difference between block level and inline elements in HTML is iin how they are displayed on a webpage. Block elements like div and p take up the full width of available space and always starts on a new line stacking vertically. This means they create a blick of content pushing as much with as needed pushing other elements to the next line. On the other hand, inline elements like span and a only use as much width as needed and do not start on a new line. This allow multiple inline elements to sit side by side within the same block. This distinct difference helps structure and style webpages and makes content more organized and managable
