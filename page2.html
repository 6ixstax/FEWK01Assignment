    <h2>The Breakdown</h2>

    <p>
        <font size="6">The difference between block level elements and inline elements in HTML is in how they are displayed on a webpage. Block elements like div and p take up the full width of available space and always starts on a new line stacking vertically. This means they create a block of content pushing as much width as needed, by pushing other elements to the next line. On the other hand, inline elements like span and a only, use as much width as needed and do not start on a new line. This allows multiple inline elements to sit side by side within the same block. This distinct difference helps structure and style webpages and makes content more organized and managable.
